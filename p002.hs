-- Even Fibonacci numbers
-- Problem 2

-- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
-- previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms
-- will be:

-- 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

-- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do
-- not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
