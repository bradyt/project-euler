-- By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent
-- numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is
-- 23.

lists :: [[Int]]
lists = [[3],
         [7, 4],
         [2, 4, 6],
         [8, 5, 9, 3]]

-- That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

-- Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:
