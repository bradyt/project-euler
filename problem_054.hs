-- Poker hands
-- Problem 54

-- In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are
-- ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:

--     High Card: Highest value card.
--     One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
--     Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
--     Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
--     Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
--     Flush: All cards of the same suit.
--     Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
--     Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
--     Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
--     Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.

-- The cards are valued in the order:
-- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

-- If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of
-- the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair
-- of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example,
-- both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand
-- are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then
-- the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

-- Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

-- Hand   Player 1            Player 2              Winner
-- 1      5H 5C 6S 7S KD      2C 3S 8S 8D TD        Player 2
--        Pair of Fives       Pair of Eights
-- 2      5D 8C 9S JS AC      2C 5C 7D 8S QH        Player 1
--        Highest card Ace    Highest card Queen
-- 3      2D 9C AS AH AC      3D 6D 7D TD QD        Player 2
--        Three Aces          Flush with Diamonds
-- 4      4D 6S 9H QH QC      3D 6D 7H QD QS        Player 1
--        Pair of Queens      Pair of Queens
--        Highest card Nine   Highest card Seven
-- 5      2H 2D 4C 4D 4S      3C 3D 3S 9S 9D        Player 1
--        Full House          Full House
--        With Three Fours    with Three Threes

-- The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to
-- two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by
-- a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last
-- five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid
-- (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in
-- no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.

-- How many hands does Player 1 win?
