-- Under The Rainbow
-- Problem 493

-- 70 colored balls are placed in an urn, 10 for each of the seven
-- rainbow colors.

-- What is the expected number of distinct colors in 20 randomly
-- picked balls?

-- Give your answer with nine digits after the decimal point
-- (a.bcdefghij).

-- there are 15! % (5!)^3 arrangements of colors

-- pick two colors, there 3 choose 2 ways.
-- now with those two colors, permute them around.
