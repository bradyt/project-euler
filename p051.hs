-- Prime digit replacements
-- Problem 51

-- By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out
-- that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83,
-- are all prime.

-- By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit,
-- this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among
-- the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113,
-- 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being
-- the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this
-- property.

-- Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not
-- necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an
-- eight prime value family.
