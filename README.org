#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my
solution elsewhere?

It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing
quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which
you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best
of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can
enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for
your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is
done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery.
Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.
