-- A simple algorithm

-- This method works as easily for finding the LCM of several
-- integers.

-- Let there be a finite sequence of positive integers X = (x1, x2,
-- ..., xn), n > 1. The algorithm proceeds in steps as follows: on
-- each step m it examines and updates the sequence X(m) = (x1(m),
-- x2(m), ..., xn(m)), X(1) = X, where X(m) is the mth iteration of X,
-- i.e. X at step m of the algorithm, etc. The purpose of the
-- examination is to pick the least (perhaps, one of many) element of
-- the sequence X(m). Assuming xk0(m) is the selected element, the
-- sequence X(m+1) is defined as

--     xk(m+1) = xk(m), k â‰  k0
--     xk0(m+1) = xk0(m) + xk0(1).

-- In other words, the least element is increased by the corresponding
-- x whereas the rest of the elements pass from X(m) to X(m+1)
-- unchanged.

-- The algorithm stops when all elements in sequence X(m) are equal.
-- Their common value L is exactly LCM(X).
