-- Cubic permutations
-- Problem 62

-- The cube, 41063625 (345^3), can be permuted to produce two other
-- cubes: 56623104 (384^3) and 66430125 (405^3). In fact, 41063625 is
-- the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its
-- digits which are also cube.

-- Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its
-- digits are cube.
