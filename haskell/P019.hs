-- Counting Sundays
-- Problem 19

-- You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do
-- some research for yourself.

--  +  1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
--  +  Thirty days has September,
--     April, June and November.
--     All the rest have thirty-one,
--     Saving February alone,
--     Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
--     And on leap years, twenty-nine.
--  +  A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not
--     on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

-- How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the
-- twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
