-- Largest exponential
-- Problem 99

-- Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not
-- difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 =
-- 2187.

-- However, confirming that 632382^518061 > 519432^525806 would be much
-- more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

-- Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a
-- 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent
-- pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest
-- numerical value.

-- NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the
-- example given above.

-- compare (632382^518061) (519432^525806)
