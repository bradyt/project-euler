module P079 where

-- Passcode derivation
-- Problem 79

-- A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user
-- for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the
-- passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th
-- characters; the expected reply would be: 317.

-- The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login
-- attempts.

-- Given that the three characters are always asked for in order,
-- analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret
-- passcode of unknown length.
